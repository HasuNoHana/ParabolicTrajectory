# ParabolicTrajectory
For given obstacles program counts parameters of the lowest parable that will allow to pass by the obstacles.

How it works?
1) write parameters of the obstacles, the place on axis and their height.
2) program will find the smallest angle and speed of a bullet that will allow it to pass by the obstacles
3) program prints out the value of speed and angle in degrees
